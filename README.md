# Floods-Prediction-Models
This model proposes a system that utilizes machine learning techniques to improve flood prediction. The system employs Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Linear Regression, and Decision Tree models. Then they are combined together using the Average classifier ensemble method.  

# Dataset-description
The adopted floods dataset is an extensive collection of data containing information about all the floods recorded worldwide from 1990 to 2023. It has been used in several studies. The dataset comprises approximately five thousand rows and twenty columns with each row representing a specific flood event and each column representing the features and factors that affect flood occurrence. These attributes are monsoon intensity, topography drainage, river management, deforestation, urbanization, climate change, dam quality, siltation, agricultural practices, encroachments, ineffective disaster preparedness, drainage systems, coastal vulnerability, landslides, watersheds deteriorating infrastructure, population score, wetland loss, inadequate planning, political factors.
